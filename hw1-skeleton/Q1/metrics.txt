The average degree is the average number of links per node. 
The average is 1.5 which means for every 3 nodes there are two vertices.
This shows, based on my algorithm, most popular movies took the similar movies as direct edge. 

The diameter is the length of the longest edge among all the shortest edges. Diameter is the max hops from one node to another. 

The average length path is 1.6 and the max is 6. This means, at maximum, it take 6 hops to get from one node to another.
Gephi calculates the average path length for "Network Diameter".
